# Visual Testing with Playwright

## Overview
This project is designed to perform **visual regression testing** using Playwright. It captures screenshots of web pages or elements and compares them with baseline images to detect visual differences. The primary objective is to ensure the UI remains consistent across releases.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or above)
- Playwright installed globally or as a project dependency

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Verify Playwright installation and dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Baseline Capture:**
   - The first run captures baseline screenshots of specified pages or elements.
   - These are stored in the `screenshots/baseline` folder.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Subsequent runs capture new screenshots and compare them against the baseline.
   - Any visual differences are stored in the `screenshots/diff` folder.

3. **Threshold:**
   - A mismatch threshold (e.g., `0.01` for 1%) is defined to allow minor acceptable deviations.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Tests fail if the mismatch exceeds the defined threshold, and differences are logged.

## Running Tests

### Baseline Setup
To create baseline screenshots:
```bash
npx playwright test --grep @setup
```

### Visual Regression Tests
To run visual comparison tests:
```bash
npx playwright test --grep @test
```

---

## Report Generation

### Playwright HTML Report
1. Open the generated report:
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

### Allure Report (Optional)
To integrate with Allure:

1. Generate the report:
   ```bash
   npm run allure-test-report
   ```

---

## Best Practices
1. **Use Stable Baselines:**
   - Ensure baseline images are consistent and represent the expected UI.
2. **Environment Consistency:**
   - Run tests in the same resolution and browser to avoid false positives.
3. **Threshold Tuning:**
   - Adjust the mismatch threshold for acceptable deviations.

---

## Common Issues
1. **False Positives:**
   - Caused by dynamic content like ads or animations. Use static mocks if possible.
2. **Mismatch Failures:**
   - Ensure the test environment matches the baseline capture environment.
3. **Error: `invalid comment length` in Merge Reports:**
   - Ensure all test results are valid before merging.
